Tensorboard is a tool often used in machine learning. It provides measurements and visualizations during the machine
learning workflow. It could present graphs and tables for metrics like loss or accuracy.
This quickstart will show how to quickly get dealt with these metrics.

Firstly, open a new terminal with the path associated to the code project. Then, activate the virtual environment


msan126@bn391471:/hpc/msan126/opt/Tutorial$ source    hpc/msan126/PycharmProjects/tutorial/venv/bin/activate
(venv) msan126@bn391471:/hpc/msan126/opt/Tutorial$ tensorboard --logdir=/hpc/msan126/opt/Pectoral_muscle/test_training_t2_batch1/
Then, click on the link.
